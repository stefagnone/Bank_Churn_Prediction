# Bank Churn Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed a predictive model to determine customer churn for a bank, utilizing Kaggleâ€™s Bank Churn Dataset. The model identifies key features that contribute to churn and provides insights into customer retention strategies.

The analysis focused on:
- Handling missing values in the dataset.
- Building and evaluating a classification model.
- Predicting churn status for a new customer dataset.

The model helps the bank understand customer behavior and make informed decisions on retaining clients.

## Technologies Used
- **R**: Data processing, analysis, and modeling
- **Machine Learning**: Classification algorithms for predictive modeling
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Model accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity

## Repository Structure
- `Data/`: Contains datasets used in the analysis (`BankChurnDataset.csv`, `NewCustomerDataset.csv`).
- `Code/`: R script with the data preparation, modeling, and evaluation code (`classification.r`).
- `Images/`: Contains any visuals generated from the analysis.

## Key Insights
- The model achieved a high accuracy rate, with notable specificity and sensitivity, indicating effective churn prediction.
- Key predictors of customer churn include account duration, balance, and transaction frequency.
- The model provides actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the R script (`classification.r`) in RStudio or another compatible R environment.
3. Ensure all necessary packages are installed.
4. Review the model output and insights from the predictions.
